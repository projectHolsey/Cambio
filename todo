Going forward.

Currently making into a multiplayer option

> Display cards is funky again
> Issue with 'discarding' new card && another player having a card that can also be discarded.

> Everything to do with game_dealer needs to be split so you can make into an online game






IDEAS :
> Whilst everyone else is 'waiting', maybe make an interactable option
    OR!!! A running chatroom that is shown WHILST a player is doing their turn
