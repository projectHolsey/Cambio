Single player instance:

FIXED 13/04 - when discarding a new card, the user is still shown a deck of their old hand (confusing)
- When you hit cambio, it will also take into account the NEW card, even though it's not in your hand
( make the card into a generic base class - inherit from it for a cambio card )


- Need to make this into a 2 player experience
