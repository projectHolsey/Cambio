> Server 'sends' card to next client

2 - Replace card
> User chooses card to replace (1,2,3,4)
> User sends a card to top of pile

3 - Use card 'ability'

> Server asks every (y) user if they want to discard the card
> Client response Y/N

> Game is stopped
> Each player's cards are shown
> Server asks all clients for cards numerical value / sum
> Client responds with total
> Server adds up all client's totals and displays scores.

11 - Current round is finished
> server sends 'reset_hand' to each player.
> Server sends updated player's scores

> server deals cards to player

13 - Reset game instance
> client types 'reset' as an option for the game.

> server sends (OK) to client
> Client removes a card from hand
